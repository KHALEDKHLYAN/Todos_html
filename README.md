The TODO's app above is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The application allows users to add and manage their daily tasks as a todo list.

The HTML code creates a form with an input field for users to add their tasks and a list to display them. 
The CSS code styles the page elements, including the form, input field, list, and text instructions.

The JavaScript code is the main functionality of the application. It handles the logic for adding, updating, and deleting tasks from the todo list.

It can be easily modified and extended to include additional features such as due dates, reminders, and priority levels.
